# CLAUDE.md - Project Guidelines

## üß≠ Project Navigation

- Always use `git ls-files` to explore and understand the project structure
- Always use `fd` instead of `find` and `rg` instead of `grep` for efficient code searches. ripgrep search capabilty is better than grep
- If valid mcp of lsp (language server protocol), use it first to navigate and check diagnostics errors


## Naming Convention Guidelines
- Core Principles
- When naming files, variables, functions, and other code elements, follow these principles:
- Be specific and descriptive - Names should clearly communicate purpose and functionality
- Avoid using adjectives in file names, If you encounter one fix the namings. Naming convention is the most important thing of project.
- Branch naming convention shortly: `[type]-[description]` (e.g., `feature-user-profile`)
- Avoid duplicating the files and folders

## üìÅ File & Code Organization
Be consistent - Use the same patterns throughout the codebase
Use domain terminology - Leverage industry-standard terms relevant to your field
- Instead of creating new file, modify existing files
- All files and variables must have semantic and clear
- Use professional, industry-standard terminology for all code elements
- Organize files according to project structure, not in arbitrary locations
- Use path aliases when the project supports them
- Use LSP to verify if a variable is referenced elsewhere in the codebase

## ‚úÖ Code Quality

- Write purposeful code - every line should serve a clear function
- Don't break working parts of the codebase
- Implement proper error handling for all operations
- Avoid console logs unless absolutely necessary for debugging critical issues
- When uncertain about implementation, analyze the existing codebase first
- Never use mock data if real implementation is requested
- Include unit tests with appropriate coverage for all components
- Follow the agreed code style (enforced by linters)
- Use TypeScript for all new JavaScript code

## üìù Documentation

- Update documentation in the same PR as code changes
- Include READMEs for all major components
- Document usage examples for components
- Use diagrams to explain complex algorithms
- Add code comments explaining "why" not just "what"
- Document potential bottlenecks

## üåü Best Practices

- Frequently check errors with tool like LSP or tsc like depend on the language
- **IMPORTANT**: Avoid using commit messages signature like Generated by Claude
- Create a TODO task list before starting work
- Structure TODOs with clear, actionable items
- Verify code with LSP diagnostics before finishing tasks
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use semantic commit messages following conventional commits format (e.g., `feat: add user authentication`)
- Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
- Use feature flags for features that span multiple releases
- Profile performance before/after significant changes
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use yarn over npm
- Avoid using fallback methods unless specified

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling Usage

- NEVER use custom scripts to edit codes
- Use available project tooling for linting, building, testing
- Check error output and make suggested fixes
